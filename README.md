# Ableton

The purpose of this repository is to offer Ableton related content. Please not that everything has only been tested under Ableton Live 11 Suite.

Basically, I am sharing the scripts that I am using (or that I did use). For each device, you can find either `User Remote Scripts`, `Midi Remote Scripts` or both. If you are interested into Ableton scripting, you can find more information [here](https://medium.com/@ibekso/ableton-scripts-34d615c37aa2). 

The following devices currently included are:
- Native Instruments
    - Komplete Kontrol A61
    - Komplete Kontrol M32
- Teenage Engineering
    - Teenage engineering OP1 (developed by https://github.com/marctdt/op-1-ableton-live-control-surface/tree/live-11)
