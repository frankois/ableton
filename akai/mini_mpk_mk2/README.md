- *default_presets* --> this folder contains original Akai Mini MK2 preset files. This can be usefull fi you tweaked your configuration but want to come back to its factory presets. It contains `.mk2` preset files, which are  specific files containing Akai Mini MPK mk2 configurations. In order to load them, you have to use the `MPK Mini MK2 Editor` that you can find [here](https://www.akaipro.com/mpk-mini-mkii). Those presets have been provided by **Bradley Andrew** and you can find more about his work [here](https://growthis.blog/2019/08/01/akai-mpk-mini-mkii-factory-default-presets/).

You then have to load them in order to be able to use those scripts into that are Ableton Live 9. Those files have not been ported on Ableton Live 10 or 11 so far. but could help anyone who would want to update them.
