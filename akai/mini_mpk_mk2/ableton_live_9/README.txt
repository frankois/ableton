This zip-file contains two folders.

"MPKmini" is the folder in which the userconfig.txt file is located.

Copy this folder to the "User Remote Scripts" folder (this is in a different location on Mac and Windows, please have a look below).

Windows: Users\<Your Username>\App Data\Roaming\Ableton\<Live Version>\Preferences\User Remote Scripts

Mac:  Macintosh HD>Users>[yourusername]>Library>Preferences>Ableton>[Live Version]>User Remote Scripts

Be aware that you have to copy this for each version of Live you want to use it with.

Set the preferences for the MPK mini in Ableton Live's control surface dialogue (The control surface script is at the bottom of the drop down menu). 

 

 

 

The second folder in this zip-file "MPKmini Presets" contains four presets for the MPK mini.

Load them using the MPK mini editor. Be sure to hit upload before you switch to the next preset or close the editor.

Now the remote script works as follows:


Preset 1 (Drumrack + Macros)

The padbanks control a drumrack if selected (otherwise C1 upward) and the encoders control a device when it is selected (indicated by a little blue and in the device header).

If you select "CC" on your MPKmini the first padbank works like this:

empty	lock	next bank	prev bank
play	stop	record		loop


This first padbank is the same on all four presets.

"Lock" binds the macro control to the currently selected device. Next/prev step through the macrobanks. The rest does as it says.

The second padbank lets you switch between macro banks 1 - 8.

Preset 2 (Volume + Arm)

The padbanks play notes from C2 upwards.

The encoders control the volume of tracks 1 - 8.

If you select "CC" on your MPKmini pads 1 - 4 on the first padbank act like in preset 1, pad 5 - 8 are free to use.

The second padbank arms tracks 1 -8.

Preset 3 (Send 1)

The Padbanks play from C3 upwards.

The encoders control sends 1 of track 1 - 8.

With "CC" selected  pads 1 - 4 on the first padbank act like in preset 1, pad 5 - 8 and padbank 2 are free to use (with different CCs).

Preset 4 (Send 2)

The Padbanks play from C4 upwards.

The encoders control sends 2 of track 1 - 8.

Hit "CC" and pads 1 - 4 on the first padbank act like in preset 1, pad 5 - 8 and padbank 2 are again free to use (once more with different CCs).

You might want to assign the "free to use" pads to functions in Ableton Live entering the MIDI Map Mode by hitting ctrl+m. Save this as your default template (Preferences>File/Folder>Save current set as default).
